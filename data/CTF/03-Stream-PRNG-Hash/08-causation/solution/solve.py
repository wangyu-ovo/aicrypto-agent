# The internal state of the RNG (one of the Xoroshiro 1024 PRNGs) is an LFSR, it is linear.
# Namely, if f is the function that maps one state to the next, f(a^b) = f(a)^f(b)
# This means that if we know the difference between two RNG states, then we know the difference
# for all the states after that. Now given that the the final output depends mainly on the high
# bits of res, which in turn relies mostly on just a few bits in the state, we can find certain
# calls within the RNG with a certain salt. For example if the difference between two states is
# 0 in the bits which matter, most likely the outputs of both RNGs will match.
# Doing this analysis is a bit annoying to do, so instead we just simulate the correlation, and
# find the points in the state where there is a high correlation of at least 40%.
